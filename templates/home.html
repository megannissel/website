      <p>I'm Megan. I'm a Python developer with {{years}}+ years of experience building and maintaining website infrastructure&mdash;backend, frontend, database, and testing.</p>
      <p>I started working at <b style="color: #43b6b1;">The Data Incubator</b> (TDI), a data science training and education company, in May 2015. Since 2020, I've been the sole developer responsible for maintaining all of TDI's infrastructure. This has included all of the webpages and services associated with the Fellowship's: application and admissions process; registration process; student-facing resources; admin-facing dashboards; task automation; and API integrations.</p>
      <p>I also manage Jenkins continuous integration pipelines for 9 production repos, and I've been responsible for writing out a suite of ~900 unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure the stability of TDI's infrastructure.</p>

      <p><b>I've got experience with...</b> Python, Flask, Poetry, Docker, Svelte, Jenkins CI, Google Cloud Platform (Application Engine, Datastore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Tasks), MySQL, Git. I've also worked with several APIs, including Zoom, Adobe Sign, Stripe, and Netlify. I'm a Linux person; Ubuntu is my preferred OS (both professionally and personally), and I enjoy working from the command line via the power of tmux and vim.</p>
      <p><b>The biggest project I've ever managed</b> was migrating my company's main GAE-hosted Flask app from Python 2.7 to Python 3.9. This application consists of ~62k lines of Python (plus plenty of HTML templates, CSS, and JS); the conversion required a complete overhaul of our development and testing infrastructure, and careful deployment planning to ensure a seamless transition for our users. I was the only developer working on the project.</p>
